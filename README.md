# Find the Most Frequent Word in a Python List

## Project Level 2: Intermediate

This project is designed for intermediate learners who know Python fundamentals and are practicing building complete programs.

## Project Description
Write a program that takes a list of words and finds the most frequently occurring one. Start by writing this list in the first line of your program:

```
words = ["love", "peace", "joy", "love", "happiness", "love", "joy"]
```

## Expected Output
Your program should find the most frequent word and print out a message similar to the following where the most frequent word (i.e., “love“) is is mentioned.

##  Learning Benefits
